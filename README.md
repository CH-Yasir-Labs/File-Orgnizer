# File-Orgnizer
This Python script organizes files in a folder by sorting them into categories like Images, Documents, Videos, Music, and more based on their extensions. It scans files, creates necessary directories, and moves them using `os` and `shutil`. Unknown file types go into an "Others" folder. This helps keep directories clean and organized efficiently.
